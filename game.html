        <p class="description"> Citation is an episodic mobile and desktop web game made in the amazing open-source Godot Game Engine. You play as a fledgling, if not forgetful scholar of magic on a hunt for your lost notes. In the process, youâ€™ll absorb some common-sense knowledge about what it means to be an ethical scholar. This is our first full game as a studio and we all learned a lot about what it takes to make a performant, interesting and educational web game.</p>
